Comments: Please use the standard kernel 2 commands:
          make clean
          make
          ./weenix -n
          
          "vfstest" kshell command
          	    This will invoke vfstest_main() 
          	    (with argc=1 and argv=NULL) in "kernel/test/vfstest/vfstest.c

Special DBG setting in Config.mk for certain tests: No
Comments on deviation from spec (you will still lose points, but it's better to let the grader know): No
General comments on design decisions: 
We lost marks for DBG statement format last time, and for self checks. We have corrected those this time, for kernel1 as well

For self checks, our format is
