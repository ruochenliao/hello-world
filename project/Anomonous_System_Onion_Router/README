There are two steps to run this program
1 config the tunnel
2 command to run this program
make
sudo ./projc config_file
make clean

3 attention: When input ctrl + c in the terminal, the program can not kill itself

Router System - Tor Project, Onion Router (Fedora)                                     Sep. 2014 - Dec. 2014
Proxy Router randomly chose routers to build virtual circuit, muti-encrypted ICMP/TCP/UDP packets; Onion Router decrypted the packets layer by layer, distinguished packets and passed packets to the next router.
•	Developed muti-process network infrastructure using socket programming, C++
•	Built virtual circuit, encrypted/ decrypted packets with (AES)Advanced Encryption Standard encryption
•	Used Wireshark to analyze and debug sudo packet header, IP address, port number, checksum and sequence number
